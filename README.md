**Part 1: Interactive Widgets**
**Enhance Send Money Page:**

UI Elements: Add a TextField for the recipient's name and amount, a DropdownButton for selecting the payment method, and a Switch for marking the transaction as a favorite.
Styling: Ensure all elements are visually appealing and aligned properly within the layout.

Form Validation:

Implement validation rules for the TextFields:
Recipient name must not be empty.
Amount must be a positive number.
Provide visual feedback (e.g., error messages) when validation fails.


**Part 2: Custom Widgets**

Create Reusable Button:

Design a custom button widget specifically for sending money, ensuring it’s reusable across different screens.
UI Consistency:

Apply consistent styles to all custom widgets, including colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain a cohesive look throughout the app.

**Part 3: Animations**
Implement UI Animations:

Use AnimatedContainer or AnimatedOpacity to create a smooth transition for important UI elements, like the success message after a transaction.
Page Transitions:

Add custom transitions between the login page and the dashboard to improve the visual flow of the app.
